\section{Software Requirements}
Before any software was written, a list of requirements for the software was made. These are features that the software must have in order to fulfill the relevant objectives, and were subsequently tested throughout the development of the web application:
\begin{enumerate}
    \label{softwareReqs}
    \item Allow a user to enter Dyck words.
    \item Validate a given input and provide a relevant error message if required.
    \item Display the given Dyck word with the ability for manual interaction via a mouse.
    \item Verify that the characters selected are a valid move before allowing them to be paired.
    \item Allow for the use of strategies from literature (Simple), as well as our own strategies (Greedy).
    \item If selecting a strategy, generate a list of moves before visualising the play.
    \item Display the list of moves, and allow the user to jump to any move in the play.
    \item Display a running width counter from the moves seen so far, and the width of the overall play if a strategy has been used.
    % \item (OPTIONAL) Allow for a mix between manual re-pairing and the use of pre-defined strategies (e.g. re-pairing the first half of a word using a strategy, and completing the second half using manual selections).
    \item Allow the user to brute force a given list of Dyck Words, and return the optimal widths of each along with the re-pairing.
\end{enumerate}
