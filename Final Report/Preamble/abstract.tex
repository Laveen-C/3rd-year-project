The project expands on the work of Chistikov and Vyali, which introduced a simple one-player game; The re-pairing game can be played on any well-formed sequence of opening and closing brackets (a Dyck word). A move consists of "pairing" any opening bracket with any closing bracket to the right of it, and "erasing" the two. The process is repeated until we are left with 0 remaining brackets. Such a game can have many strategies, but the effectiveness of a strategy is measured by it's width, which is the maximum number of nonempty segments of symbols seen during a play of the game.
