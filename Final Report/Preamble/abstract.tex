The project expands on the work of Chistikov and Vyali, which introduced a simple one-player game; The re-pairing game can be played on any well-formed sequence of opening and closing brackets (a Dyck word). A move consists of "pairing" any opening bracket with any closing bracket to the right of it, and "erasing" the two. The process is repeated until we are left with no remaining brackets. Such a game can have many strategies, but the effectiveness of a strategy is measured by it's width, which is the maximum number of nonempty segments of symbols seen during a play of the game.
