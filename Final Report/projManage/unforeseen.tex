\section{Issues Encountered}

One of the largest risks from the beginning of this project has been the possibility that obtaining new findings on the open problem from the seminal work \cite{chistikov2020re} turns out to be an infeasible task. When the project first begun, one of the goals was to attack this problem from a more theoretical approach. However, after further effort during term 1 this approach was found to be unproductive. 
Fortunately, this was taken into account early on, and the goal shifted from a theoretical approach to a more software oriented approach with an emphasis on visualisation.

An unforeseen issue on the author's health made it difficult to complete this report for the original timeline. However, after some deliberation with an incredibly supportive department, the author was granted an opportunity to extend the timeline for this report. The resulting timeline can be seen in the next section.
