To-Do for proj:
- Have algorithms be in a select menu
  * Placed into a select menu!
  * Create a separate button for actually working out the re-pairing steps according to the selected algorithm
  * Another button for actually running the generated steps! (Grey this out unless steps have been generated (if steps array empty then inactive?)

- Implement a slider for step/instant options with a text field for time between steps (0 for manual stepping)
- Display result of algorithms on the webpage
- Display corresponding tree for dyck word
- Come up with algorithm to generate dyck words efficiently, and efficient brute forcing techniques to find optimal width
- Compare greedy recursive approach (smallest length and width, but width would require hashing? Unsure how to approach this)
- Fix layout of website
- Manual re-pairing option? Turning each bracket into a button etc.
